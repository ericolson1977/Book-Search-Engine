# Book-Search-Engine
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
With the goal of utilizing the most efficient technologies to handle data and user needs, I have refactored a Book search engine. The search engine was originally built using a RESTful API. I refactored so that it is now a GraphQL API built with Apollo server.

When the app is loaded, the user can immediately begin searching for books. The user will be presented with a login/signup option. Once the user is full signed up or logged in, they will have the ability to save a book from the search results. They can then view all their saved books in one place. Finally, the user can delete any book from their saved list.
